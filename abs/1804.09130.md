## High-level points

* "design toolkit for quantum optimization"
  * for converting optimization problems to QAOA, VQE, annealing
* efficiently mapping boolean functions to fourier sums of pauli Z operators on Hamiltonians
  * $H_f|x\rangle = f(x)|x\rangle$
* computational complexity of the mapping:
  * It's "#P-hard" to compute the Hamiltonian of a CNF (because the optimal solution is encoded in a coefficient)
  * but efficient for sums of (local) Boolean clauses (related to MAX-CUT, etc)
* using this construction, can make CSP objective functions and controlled unitaries
