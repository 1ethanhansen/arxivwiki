## Overview ##
* Conventional method of fault-tolerance is using transversal gates.
* In topological quantum computing, <em>locality preserving logical operations</em> are generalization of transversal gates.
  * Operations map between local errors.
* Another approach: <strong>braiding of topological defects</strong>
  * Allows for implementation of gates that would otherwise be much more difficult to implement using conventional transversal gates.
