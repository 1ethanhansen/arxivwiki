## Main idea
depth-1 QAOA generates a distribution that cannot be efficiently sampled

## Details
* explains QAOA, polynomial hierarchy (PH), post-selected quantum computing
* efficiently computing the matrix elements of QAOA on a classical computer would collapse PH
* efficient sampling of arbitrary quantum circuits implies PH collapse (using post-selected quantum computing)

They also discuss the adiabatic algorithm (they call it QADI, but others call it QAA);
they show that even with a quantum adiabatic oracle, efficiently sampling from depth-1 QAOA would collapse PH.
