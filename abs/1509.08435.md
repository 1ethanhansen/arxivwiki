This article shows a guideline for long distance (>1000 Km) quantum communications channels.
It is articulated on 3 generatios Quantum Repeaters and characteristics of each one. 
First generations are based on HEP and HEG
2nd generatiosn repeaters are on HEP and QEC, wheres the third generations architecture is based on QEC
