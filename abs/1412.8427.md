## Main points

This is a potential use for boson sampling.(simple, non-universal form of quantum computing)

Unclear, but possible that estimating boson sampling is inefficient, related to matrix permanents.


## how this works
* bosons sampled as output distribution of photons from a linear quantum optical network
* coherent light to excite identical molecules and measured scattered radiation to infer vibrational spectra

These two are equivalent with a non-linear state preparation step.

## More details
* it is hard to calculate franck-condon factors with duschinsky mode mixing
* by modifying the input state, this can be performed efficiently with boson sampling
