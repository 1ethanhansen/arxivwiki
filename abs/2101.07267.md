## Main idea
* using a classical computer to optimize VQE or QAOA is NP-hard.

## Implications
* It is hard to figure out what parameters are best for a quantum circuit!
* It's not about the hardness of "finding the ground state" (QMA hardness), it's about the optimization procedure

## Four settings showing hardness
1. oracle: quantum computer; proving the optimization is NP-hard even if constant relative precision
2. ground state problem is easy; log(n) qubits
3. ground state problem is easy; free fermions
4. ground state problem is easy; QAOA setup
