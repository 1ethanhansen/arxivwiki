Welcome to the arXiv wiki. Anything that "accompanies" an arXiv paper belongs here:

* informal summaries of papers
* links to talks and presentations
* comments about the work

If you'd like to contribute, visit the project on GitHub to make a change. Once your first change is approved, you'll receive full access to make further changes and invite others.

I hope this becomes a useful resource for all kinds of researchers, especially those getting started in a new field.
